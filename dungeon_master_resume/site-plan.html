      <h3>Campaigns</h3>
      <p>
        Campaigns
        Running from a ghost pirate ship, hunting for a long lost city on a newly discovered and dangerous continent, going to a formal ball with a 'demonic' twist, and hunting down the remnants of a dead god's cult.  These adventures and more can be found here.  For beginners, we recommend the 'Lost City of Orazca' questline.  It is fairly straightforward and helps players and DM's alike to better understand the mechanics of Dungeons and Dragons and how your playgroup works together.  Feel free to expound and change things in your campaign according to your will!  For experienced players, we recommend the 'Cult of the Deep One' storyline.  It is a lower level campaign, but we feel that adds to the challenge of the quest.  Players must solve the mystery of the terrible smell coming from the sewers and find the island where an ancient, arcane ritual is about to commence!  Regardless of your experience and play style, we have a campaign for you!  Have any ideas for a possible campaign or one-shot?  Message us with the details and we can write one for you. 
        
        Dungeon Masters for Hire
        A common problem with a group of people that wants to play Dungeons and Dragons is that everyone wants to be a player, and no-one wants to run the game.  Luckily, we solve that problem for you.  We can provide you with a dungeon master to run any of our campaigns or one-shots and allow you forever DM’s to finally play that character you’ve had waiting in the wings for three years.  Our skilled DM’s will provide you with a fun and satisfying weekend.  If you find one you like, you can request them to run a longer campaign for your group (up to the specific DM’s discretion).  
        
          Meet the DM
        Hello!  My name is James and I am a Dungeon Master, chief writer for all of our campaigns and one-shots, and the founder of Custom Adventures.  I have been a Dungeon Master for three years and have run many adventures and one-shots of all varieties.  I have commandeered all of the adventures that we publish and love them all to bits! Feel free to contact me with any questions about my availability and campaign ideas.  My favorite adventure to run is the ‘Cult of the Deep One,’ one of my first written adventures and one that I ran for my personal play group.

          The Cult of the Deep One
