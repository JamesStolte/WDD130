    <h2>James Stolte</h2>
    <p>Hello!  My name is James Stolte.  I am currently living in Rexburg and am married to my eternal companion Amelia.  I am a computer science major and took a break from school for a little bit so that my wife could finish up her esthetic degree.</p>
    <p>I love to play games of all varieties and genres, but my favorites are roguelites.  I am an avid fan of the works of Brandon Sanderson and love to play Dungeons and Dragons.  I have recently gotten into painting miniatures and am loving it!</p>
    <p>I served a mission in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma from 2019 to 2020 and had to go home early due to asthma and covid, but I loved my time there.  I love listening to prophet peptalk (link below) and reading the Book of Mormon.</p>

    <p>I love to talk to people and hear their stories, and can't wait to get to know y'all!</p>
